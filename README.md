# React + Material-UI + Firebase [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Phoqe/react-material-ui-firebase.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Phoqe/react-material-ui-firebase)

This project is an application skeleton for a typical [React](https://reactjs.org) project. It comes bundled with [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com), [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com), and [React Router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router). With [Create React App](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app) at its core, you can use it to bootstrap your projects and development environment with the same tooling.

## Features

React + Material-UI with Login comes with a bunch of development and testing tools for instant web development gratification.

This is based on

Instead of firebase, you can use another backend to authenticate the email and password (see "fetch" in App.js)
